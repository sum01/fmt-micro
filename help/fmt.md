# fmt plugin
To get a list of supported formatters, run the `fmt` command, or read the `README.md`

To enable the individual formatters, run `set FormatterName true`.  
When saving a supported file-type, the plugin will automatically run on the file & save any changes.

Please note that all formatters are disabled by default, as to not accidentally format your files. You must enable them individually for this plugin to do anything.
